# ACE Vehicle Medical
## About
Simple script mod which adds an ace interaction to vehicles (Helicopters only at present), which allows for easy filtering of uninjured or stable personel - giving medics a head start when picking up multiple wounded, unstable members in medevac/casevac or hot extract scenarios.

## Features

* Added to anything that inherits from `Helicopter`.
* Menu which lists unstable passengers
* Submenus which list what of the 3 afflictions they suffer from
    * Bleeding (Actively)
    * Unconscious
    * Cardiac Arrest
